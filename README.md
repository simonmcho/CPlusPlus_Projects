If you dug this deep, I appreciate you for visiting my page!  
  
My ultimate goal is to not just become an awesome programmer, but to create my own brand and company someday.  
In order to do so, I believe these are the areas that I need to focus on:  
- Awesome web, mobile, and desktop application development skills
- Understanding marketing strategies, both in the digital and non-digital sector
- Learning the market: Trends, demands, needs, etc.
- Communication skills with clients, co-workers, and just about anyone else. This is more of a Life Pro Tip then anything :)
- Digging in deep with content creation
- Working well with others
- Executing!!!
